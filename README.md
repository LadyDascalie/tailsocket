# Tailsocket

Tailsocket lets you tail a file directly in your browser.

So far, it's tailored for apache access/error logs, but it can tail any other type of logs you want to throw at it

There are still lots of improvements that can be made. But I just needed a quick solution to accomplish this.

Feel free to contribute !
